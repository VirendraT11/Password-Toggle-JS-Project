# Password Toggle Project 🚀

Welcome to the **Password Toggle Project**! This is a sleek and modern JavaScript project designed to showcase my skills in web development. The main feature of this project is the password visibility toggle functionality, which allows users to easily show or hide their password using an eye icon.

## Features ✨
- **Eye Icon Toggle**: Switch between an open and closed eye image to show or hide the password.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and looks great on any device.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and minimalistic design with intuitive interactions.

## How It Works 🔍
When the eye icon is clicked:
- If the password is hidden, it changes to plain text and the icon switches to an open eye image.
- If the password is visible, it changes back to hidden and the icon switches to a closed eye image.

This simple yet effective feature enhances the user experience by providing a clear and easy way to manage password visibility.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **HTML**: Structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling the elements for a modern and clean look.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing the interactive toggle feature.

## Project Structure 📁
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the input box and eye icon.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the input box and positions it in the center of the screen.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the password toggle feature.

## Conclusion 🏁
This project is a great example of how a simple feature can significantly enhance user experience. It highlights my proficiency in JavaScript and my ability to create interactive web components. I hope you find this project impressive and useful.
